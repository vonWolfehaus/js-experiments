# Experiments

### Endless paging

[View demo](http://coldconstructs.com/p/endlesspages/endlessPages.html). Demo I created back in 2007 or so, long before it became common on the web.

### Autoscrolling

[View demo](http://www.coldconstructs.com/p/autoscroll/autoScroll.html). Trying out an idea I had to scroll by moving the mouse to the top or bottom of the viewport. Created in 2007 as well, before touchscreens were commonplace (the first iPhone was released in 2008).
